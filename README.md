This repository contains Joomla templates for Leoeandhyde's websites. Since all
websites share the bulk of the html and css code here, and since I wished to
use CSS variables (which are not supported by some browsers), I introduced a
small "compilation" step to generate the actual templates in an output
directory. To generate the files, run `python3 compile.py` from the root
directory.
