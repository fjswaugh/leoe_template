Lack of content
Too much text on pages, break with bolded headings and pictures
Automatic social media feeds
About Us - People - Shows

About Us:
    Link to Queueueueu and Marriage FB pages whenever they're mentioned
    Social media links at bottom

My idea:
    Make generic bottom header with address, social media links, etc.

People:
    Add websites to personal bios: leoemercer.com, stephenjghyde.com
    Leo -> executive producer
    Leo -> writer (instead of librettist)
    Baby photos and picture of 2 together

Shows:
    Add photos
    Format better

He also wants more quotes on the homepage
